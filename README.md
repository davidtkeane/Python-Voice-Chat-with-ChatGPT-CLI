    <b>Welcome to ChatGPT on the command line used with API!</b> 
    <p>This project, "Python-Voice-Chat-with-ChatGPT-CLI" allows you to converse with chatgpt (OpenAI) using your voice, utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3 model and speech recognition to facilitate a chat interaction between users and a bot through voice input. By leveraging the microphone and computer capabilities, users can engage in conversations with the bot, with the dialogue history being logged into a text file. The bot's responses are also audibly communicated using Pyttsx3.</b>
